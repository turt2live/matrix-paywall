# matrix-paywall

A way to charge for matrix services (bridges, bots, etc) without implementing payment processing in each application. This is intended to be used by bridges who require payment processing or homeserver owners who wish to offer paid services, such as [matrix-appservice-twilio](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-appservice-twilio).

# Features

* [ ] NodeJS library to interact with a paywall instance
* [ ] Payment handling (provider?)
* [ ] Alternative billing model support (pre-pay, post-pay, pay for usage, etc)
